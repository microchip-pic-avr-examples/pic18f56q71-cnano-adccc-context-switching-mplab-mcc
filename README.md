# Analog-to-Digital Converter with Computation (ADCC) and Context Switching — Context Switching Using PIC18F56Q71 Microcontroller with MCC Melody

This code example demonstrates how to perform two Analog-to-Digital Converter with Computation (ADCC) and Context Switching conversions from two input channels that have different peripheral configurations by using the Context Switching feature. The ADCC with Context Switching supports up to four configuration contexts and offers the option of switching between these contexts at runtime. By using this feature, a single ADCC with Context Switching peripheral is used to capture data from multiple analog input channels, each one of them having its own configuration. The conversion results are processed and displayed on a terminal software by using serial communication via an UART peripheral.
